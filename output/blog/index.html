    <p>Picking up Yeoman today, and in the process learned a slick trick
for GitHub Pages. A common pattern in both Nanoc and a Yeoman AngularJS
generated project is to have a built version of the site/app within
the project folder, but untracked. Previously, I set up a separate
Git repository within that subfolder in order to push to
<code>gh-pages</code> for publishing. But there’s a better way.</p>

    <p>So I can’t exactly publish this while I’m in the middle of moving my site
to <a href="http://nanoc.ws">nanoc</a>, but here’s another bash one-liner for 
mass-changing an old extension <code>*.old</code> to a new one <code>*.new</code> within a folder.</p>

<pre><code>for file in *.old; do mv "$file" "${file%.*}.new"; done
</code></pre>

<p>Pretty useful: I wanted to change from Octopress’s <code>*.markdown</code> extension to
the more typical <code>*.md</code> for my blog posts, and that saved me a few clicks!</p>

                <p>As an exercise I’ve worked through the classical result that if a space <script type="math/tex">X</script>
                is compact Hausdorff and has a <script type="math/tex">G_\delta</script>-diagonal <script type="math/tex">\Delta</script>, then <script type="math/tex">X</script> is 
                metrizable. 
                It relies on Urysohn’s theorem that regular second-countable spaces are 
                metrizable, and since compact Hausdorff spaces are normal*, I’ll just show 
                that the space is second countable.</p>
                
                <p>When I went to compare, most of proofs I found online and in texts like 
                Engleking were a lot less direct (involving characterizations
                of <script type="math/tex">G_\delta</script> diagonals using covers), so I hope someone gets 
                some use out of this fairly straight-forward attack (due to a hint from 
                my advisor Gary Gruenhage).</p>

    <p>A quick one… pretty simple but I wanted to make note of it.</p>

<p>I unwisely numbered the files in a folder like so:</p>

<p><code>
1.txt
2.txt
...
9.txt
10.txt
11.txt
12.txt
</code></p>

<p>So their alphanumeric order is not the same as the numeric order. Is there 
a quick way in the shell to renumber these with leading zeros? 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3672301/linux-shell-script-to-add-leading-zeros-to-file-names">Of course.</a></p>

    mv $a `printf %02d.%s ${a%.*} ${a##*.}` # replace number with 2-digit ver.

<p>It took me forever and a day to get this functional, so I wanted to share the 
problem and solution in case it helps someone else out there trying to 
Google their way to solve a similar puzzle.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>I inherited a ASP.NET website which was hosted at 
<code>https://www.domain.com/subdirectory/</code>. The site was coded with absolute 
links throughout of the form <code>/subdirectory/path/to/resource</code>. However, when
Visual Studio 2012 spins up IIS Express to host the site locally, the site
is hosted at <code>http://localhost:port/</code>. You can see the issue: all the 
references to <code>/subdirectory/etc</code> are now broken in the application, which 
makes previewing the site a pain.</p>

In addition to co-authoring my first ever topology paper to be submitted to a journal (I hope to share more about that soon!), I’ve spent the past couple of days hacking out an Auburn-themed version of the Ruby static site generator <a href="http://nanoc.ws">nanoc</a>.</p>

    <p>Since I recently relaunched my <a href="http://gradecalc.stevenclontz.com">grade calculator website</a> I wanted to see how the month of finals affected my traffic.</p>

<p>{% img http://i.imgur.com/Kt5JDgs.png %}</p>

<p>Basically, over a 1000 daily visits around the week before Christmas, compared to fifteen total concerned students on Christmas day.</p>

<p>While these stats aren’t surprising, I suppose it’s a nice confirmation that my analytics software passes the eyeball test for realistic statistics. When I moved off of auburn.edu I took a major hit in my Google ranking however - it’d be interesting to have statistics from a year ago (I unfortunately did not have my tracking code up and running).</p>

                <p>My last class teaching at Auburn came sooner than expected. Starting in the spring, I’ll be working as the software engineer / web developer / IT specialist for Auburn’s <a href="https://fp.auburn.edu/writing/">Office of University Writing</a>, specifically the <a href="https://fp.auburn.edu/writing/eportfolio-project/">ePortfolio Project</a>. I’m sure I’ll post more about that down the road - I start on January 7th.</p>
                
                <p>I had a great group of students in this final semester. And it seems they thought I was okay too.</p>

                <p>Back when I was in undergrad, some friends and I decided to spend our Spring Break taking a road trip to Alamogordo, New Mexico, to make a documentary about the Atari E.T. game failure. Long story short, the game was a flop, and according to the folklore millions of copies were buried in a landfill in that city.</p>
                
                <p>Unfortunately, lack of funds kept us from our mission. Occassionally I’ll be contacted about our attempt, and while there really isn’t much to say, I always try to contribute. The latest publication es en español, so I’ll add my original quote in English after the break.</p>

    <p>Today I played my final game of bowling in the “Math Nerd League 2012”. And maybe my first - I don’t know if that moniker was in use before today, but it was used to designate the group of my colleagues in the <a href="http://math.auburn.edu/">Auburn University mathematics graduate program</a> who went this afternoon.</p>

<p>I’m pretty bad at bowling (although since playing a fair bit this year I’ve improved my average to roughly 80 compared to a dismal 50). So to keep my mind on happier thoughts, I asked the question:</p>

<blockquote>How many different outcomes are there for one game of bowling?</blockquote>

                <p>In case you hadn’t heard me talk about it yet, <a href="http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/APP5_Wrap-Up">here’s my wrap-up of Auburn Puzzle Party 5</a> on the Auburn Puzzle Party wiki.</p>
                
                <p>And if you haven’t checked out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLooILs0YfKkEWPeFpZdDis2GuQ2aP-weO">APP5 videos, including the Puzzle Rock Anthem</a> yet, you’re missing out. See if you can solve the “hidden” puzzle in the videos too.</p>

    <p>Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my new blog*. After deciding I didn’t need to waste so much cash on domain names I don’t use and web space I barely needed, I took down stevenclontz.com along with most of my other old PHP/Wordpress sites. I’ll get stevenclontz.com to point here sometime soon.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://jdabbs.com">James Dabbs</a> for showing <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> to me the other day - a blogging system with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> revision control and hosting by <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> sounds alright to me.</p>

<p>I’ll be working on my <a href="../about/">About</a> page and getting my <a href="http://resume.stevenclontz.com">Resume</a> up to date over the coming days.  Email me at <a href="mailto:steven.clontz@gmail.com">steven.clontz@gmail.com</a> if you need to get in touch with me! See ya.</p>

<p><small>*Is this sentence obligatory for a first blog post? I almost always see it, and it sounded awkward not to include it. Thanks again I guess. :-)</small></p>
