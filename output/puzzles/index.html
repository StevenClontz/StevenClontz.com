            <p>I’m active in the puzzle community in Auburn, so much so that I 
<a href="http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com">made the wiki</a>!</p>

<h2 id="what-do-you-mean-by-puzzles">What do you mean by “puzzles”?</h2>

<p>Well, not jigsaw puzzles…</p>

<p>There’s a fourteen-character message hidden in the video above, which refers
to a location on or near Auburn University’s campus. Have fun!</p>

<h2 id="whats-so-cool-about-puzzles">What’s so cool about puzzles?</h2>

<p>It’s what I <a href="../math/">studied in school</a>. I came to puzzles as a mathematician, 
because <strong>mathematics is the art of problem solving</strong>, and <strong>puzzle design 
is the art of creating fun problems to solve</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="puzzlehunts">Puzzlehunts</h2>

<p>While I’m a fan of the typical Sudoku puzzle or word jumble, I’m particularly
interested in puzzlehunts: large-scale events which involve teams of players
solving puzzles, which can end up sending them across an entire campus or
town to find the solution or next puzzle. </p>

<p class="small"><img src="../assets/images/puzzlehunt.jpg" alt="Puzzlehunt"></p>

<p>I played and won my first
<a href="http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com">Auburn Puzzle Party</a> in 2009, and
lead a team of puzzle designers to create Auburn Puzzle Parties 4 and 5 from
2010-2012. My teams have won three “trophies” competing in roughly bi-annual
Auburn-area puzzle events,
placing me in the top 13 of over 300 players. Of the players who joined
the community since I did in Fall 2009, I’m tied for first.</p>

<h2 id="teaching-math-with-puzzles">Teaching math with puzzles</h2>

<p>Due to my puzzle designing experience, I was asked in 2011 to co-create the
first 
<a href="http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/AMPd/index.htm">Auburn Mathematical Puzzle (AMP’d) Challenge</a>. Our
goal was to expose non-standard mathematical topics such as game theory or
number theory to middle school students, well before they’d normally get the 
chance to encounter them formally in a post-secondary setting (if ever). More
importantly, we wanted to present mathematics as critical thinking and
problem solving in a fun enviornment.</p>

<p class="small"><img src="../assets/images/ampd.jpg" alt="AMP'd Logo"></p>

<p>We embraced the pedagoical philosophy known as <strong>Inquiry Based Learning</strong>.
Rather than teaching students a formal mathematical theory, we structured our
mathematical “Challenges” so that they could develop a theory of their own.
With our graduate student volunteers to provide guidance, players asked
themselves and each other questions which naturally helped them solve their
problems. By following up with advanced “EXTRA Challenges”, they then were
forced to generalize their solutions, and often, develop formulas or theorems
which could apply to any number of puzzles.</p>

<p>Through the AMP’d Challenge, we redefined mathematics in our students eyes.
Math isn’t a list of formulas and algorithms to memorize: it’s field of
puzzles and games to explore and solve. Not only that, but it was a great
way to introduce students to Auburn University’s campus, i.e. a great
recruiting tool. </p>

<p>If you are interested in running a puzzlehunt, mathematical or otherwise,
for your own school or organization, please 
<a href="steven.clontz@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>! I’d love to work with your
team to bring this kind of fun puzzle challenge to your campus.</p>
