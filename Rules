# A few helpful tips about the Rules file:
#
# * The string given to #compile and #route are matching patterns for
#   identifiers--not for paths. Therefore, you can’t match on extension.
#
# * The order of rules is important: for each item, only the first matching
#   rule is applied.
#
# * Item identifiers start and end with a slash (e.g. “/about/” for the file
#   “content/about.html”). To select all children, grandchildren, … of an
#   item, use the pattern “/about/*/”; “/about/*” will also select the parent,
#   because “*” matches zero or more characters.


# Static Files
compile '/assets/*' do
end

route '/assets/*' do
  item.identifier.chop + '.' + item[:extension]
end


# Website Pages
compile '*' do
  if item[:extension] == "md"
    filter :erb
    filter :kramdown
  else
    filter :haml
  end
  layout 'default'
end

route '*' do
  # Write item with identifier /foo/ to /foo/index.html
  item.identifier + 'index.html'
end

layout '*', :haml
