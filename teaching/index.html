            <p>I love teaching! I trace my interest in education back to my teenage years spent working at Camp Westmoreland running National Youth Leadership Training for the Greater Alabama Council. NYLT utilizes youth instructors for teaching all courses, giving a younger me the chance to get up and talk about the things I was passionate about, and was a great inspiration for my professional development as an adult.</p>

            <p>While at Auburn University, I had the opportunity to work with hundreds of students as the instructor of several Calculus courses. I think that I’ve done well overall, and this is reflected by the evaluations they’ve left me. I’ve included excerpts from my last four semesters at Auburn below.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Mr. Clontz has done an incredible job not only teaching his students the course material but also providing us with problems that challenge us to apply what we learn in class and take such abilities/concepts to the next level. This semester, I found that I was challenged in new ways that required critical thinking and employment of skills learned in class, and Mr. Clontz was available whenever the class hit a roadblock. He needs to update canvas in a manner that ensures the canvas grade is a clear reflection of our actual grade though!</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Fantastic teacher that had a very cool and unique teaching style that made everything very clear. He did however lack the information on what we can expect for our upcoming final which is somewhat needed and a terrible error by the department.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Calc 2 is definitely a hard course but Mr. Clontz taught it in a way that made it easier to understand. Very glad he was my professor for the semester.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Loved my class with Mr. Clontz! He understood that the material was difficult and spent more time going through most chapters. He also graded very fairly and gave many opportunities to improve you grade. Would take him again!</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Clontz is incredible. Should be a model for the math department. Best math teacher I have had at auburn so far. Keep doing you man</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Great enthusiastic teacher</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Best Calculus 2 teacher as far as I’m concerned. He taught the material in a way where it was easy to obtain and I was comfortable going home and practicing on my own. He engaged the class and allowed us to teach certain practice problems to one another, for better understanding. His lessons were brief and to the point, rather than long and drawn out. He gives the student numerous opportunities to succeed and obtain at least a B.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>I am not a math person but Mr. Clontz did an excellent job of both explaining the material and demonstrating different ways of solving problems. I would highly recommend someone to take his class if they could.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Mr. Clontz is awesome. Many STEM professors have a reputation for being hard to talk with and approach, but he is not so. He’s nice to everyone and always willing to pause if we have questions about a problem. I can tell he really wants us to do well in Calculus and in life. One potential area for improvement may be going more slowly when he’s writing on the chalkboard. I have a hard time keeping up when he’s teaching new material.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>I really liked the way he structured his course. The packets that you follow along with, the assigned problems that we present in class, and the weekly quizzes on Mondays was an effective way of teaching for me. Many people might not like the forced involvement but it really helps with engaging you with the work. You want to be able to explain the problem to the class, which helps further your own understanding.</p>

              <p>Fantastic teacher. Easily best math teacher I’ve had in college. I like how it’s a straightforward class with no tricks. The way the material is given and tested on is great. Only thing is maybe show how what we learn is applicable for us especially for engineers, but it’s not that big of a deal.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Best math teacher I’ve had at Auburn. Seems like he’s having fun teaching and really enjoys his job here at Auburn. He isn’t as mundane as the rest of the math department’s professors and teachers. Overall, a funny nice guy with a great attitude and a love for what he’s doing. Could definitely use some people like him in the physics department!</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>You did a great job this semester Steven. Your presentation of the material was clear and you made your expectations in terms of grading both clear and simple. The end of the course maaaybe felt a little rushed. […] Teach linear algebra next year. I’d appreciate having a teacher like you next semester.</p>

              <p>Great teacher. Very approachable and definitely cares about his students. He explains the subject very clearly and effectively.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>This class is the first class ive taken in auburn’s math department where the teacher cared about teaching the class. He was so helpful and he honestly wanted us to do well, he gave us material to study and help us and put extra problems on canvas to work that would help with the tests, the resources he provided us with were so helpful. He explained everything well conceptually and didn’t make the math harder than necessary. overall, Mr. Clontz is the bomb dot com, and he wore a tie to class EVERY DAY, which is very impressive. he was very accommodating for excused absences and class was fun. I also learned cal 3</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Steven was not only the best Calculus teacher I have had at Auburn, but also one of my best teachers period. His grading techniques were fair, and he did everything possible to make sure that we understood the material being taught. I would absolutely take him again for any future math classes and it was a privilege to have him as a teacher. Steven, don’t change any aspect of how you teach, it was done perfectly. Excellent job.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>Overall the class was fairly straight forward. Clontz did not like us using calculators, so he made his own problems that didn’t require calculators. Normally these ended up being much easier than what was in the book though.</p>

              <p>Mr. Clontz has easily been one of the best instructors I have had in Auburn in every aspect. He makes Calculus about as enjoyable as one could make it. His teaching techniques really helped me to learn the material that much easier. He provides plenty of examples and he leaves no room for doubt for how he makes his test. He creates a study guide that even lists how he gives partial credit so that way there is no room for error. Outside of class he was very easy to approach which was nice for me since I have never been one to visit teachers outside of class but he encourages you to and was very flexible. Mr. Clontz is definitely someone I would recommend to future students.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Really good communication with class. Excellent resources provided online.</p>

            <h3 id="fall-2012">Fall 2012</h3>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>Mr. Clontz did an excellent job teaching this course. His techniques were consistent as far as what we were to expect from him. He was frank with us about grading and made the class schedule very clear to the class. His relaxed methods concerning attendance made it an environment open to learning without the distraction of formalities. He left it up to the student to learn the material. I will say this, while I loved having a study guide for the upcoming test, I must admit I don’t think I did one outside problem. That being said, I did pretty well on the tests and feel as though his teaching style enabled me to understand the material without having to do any outside problems. He wasn’t teaching work ethic, he was teaching Calculus. And while i believe that work ethic is important, his relaxed style and class enabled me to get a core credit without killing myself and i really appreciated that.
            Things to improve on:
            Try integrating 3-d visualization software into particular problems. I could get a pretty good idea of the 3-d objects he was drawing on the board (he did do a pretty good job drawing that stuff) but if he used something like Maple, i feel like it could really benefit those not as visually inclined. Dr. Peterson knows her stuff about that so i would ask her where to start.
            maybe more structure? i didn’t need the structure, but some of these kids who have been spoon fed their entire lives need a boot-in-the-ass to do well. i personally don’t think he HAS to put in more structure, but if there is a gross failing rate or anything, that might help. structure meaning bonus attendance (like x number of points if you show up to 70% or more classes) or some real hw or something. or just let the kids fail out and give me an easier future.
            That’s pretty much it. Steven Clontz did an overall pretty good job, was open, fair, and wanted the students to succeed. its their fault if they didn’t.
            Personal note to Mr. Clontz: Thank you so much for instructing this class and may God bless your future endeavors. (if you believe in God, its kinda a hit or miss with these math and science folk.)

              <p>Great teacher. Better than my professor in Cal II.
            A little slow on grading tests but understandable.
            Grades are very fair. Can fight for a grade and if he agrees he will award you a few points.
            Very quirky, but very funny teacher.

            <blockquote>
              <p>The study guides were a little too gentle. Sometimes they were carbon copies of the tests. I think making the course a little more challenging would be better, but overall I liked the teaching.</p>
