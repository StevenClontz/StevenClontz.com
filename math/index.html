            <p>I study set-theoretic topology, particularly topological games and their
limited information strategies.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/math.png" alt="Cantor Tree Space"></p>

<p><em>The image above is an illustration of a topological space I’ve studied
based upon the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_tree">Cantor Tree</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-a-topological-game">What’s a Topological Game?</h2>

<p>As a <a href="../puzzles/">game and puzzle enthusisiast</a>, it’s probably no surprise
that I was drawn to game theory in particular when I began studying
mathematics. The types of game I like working with are two-player sequential
games: each player takes turn making a move, and at the end of the game the
result of their moves determines a winning player. (Think Tic-Tac-Toe or
chess!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~gruengf/">Dr. Gary Gruenhage</a> took me on as a student
while I worked on my master’s degree in topology, studying known properties
of LOTS: linearly ordered topological spaces, a generalization of the real
numbers. While working with him, I also took a course in descriptive set 
theory, and when I started learning about 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_determinacy_theorem">the Borel determinacy theorem</a>
I was exposed to the world of <script type="math/tex">\omega</script>-length games.</p>

<p>I was hooked! Using games, we can actually characterize the structure of
a topological space: for example, a space is Menger if and only if the first
player lacks an unbeatable strategy in a game using open covers of the space.</p>

<h2 id="considering-limited-information">Considering Limited Information</h2>

<p><script type="math/tex">\omega</script>-length means these games last a long time 
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number#Ordinals_extend_the_natural_numbers">to say the least</a>). 
So what if a player had an imperfect memory?</p>

<p>These sorts of considerations turn out to be pretty useful in finding stronger
characterizations of topological spaces. A typical example of such a strategy
is a Markov strategy: in our context, it means that the player can only
recall the number of rounds which have occurred, and the most recent move of
her opponent.</p>

<p>In the game I referred to above, the second player has an unbeatable Markov
strategy if and only if the space is a countable union of compact spaces.
Which adds up: if the second player has a Markov winning strategy, then
the first player can’t have a winning strategy. This proves that every space
which is the countable union of compact spaces is a Menger space. You could 
prove it directly, but why would you want to when there are all these fun 
games you can play instead? :-)</p>

<p>The interested mathematician who wants to learn more is encouraged to check
out 
<a href="http://www.auburn.edu/~gruengf/preprints/gamesurv9.pdf">The Story of a Topological Game</a>
which Gary Gruenhage wrote to describe a different game which
he designed as a part of his dissertation, and many of its applications found 
down the road.</p>
