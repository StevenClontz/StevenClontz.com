title: Code
---

Aside from my work in [mathematics](/math/), I've also taught myself 
programming in various languages, including Ruby, Python, Javascript, and PHP.
Naturally, a lot my work in those languages involves websites and web
applications, but I've been known to hack on a few other types of projects
as well.

My resume at <http://resume.stevenclontz.com> includes a lot of what I've
done.

### GitHub @StevenClontz

I'm a strong believer in open-source. If it weren't for free as in 
beer/speech languages and libraries I'd never have picked up programming
as a hobby, much less a profession.

My [GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz) has a bunch of my repos if you're
interested in the types of projects I'm working on.

### Web Development Portfolio

I've been creating web pages since I was in sixth grade. (Yes, an example
still exists somewhere, and no, I won't tell you how to find it.) :-)

That hobby became a part-time job in 2008 when I became the webmaster of 
the Auburn University Bands. I've worked with several CMS, static sites,
and web applcations since then. 

There's too many to list here, but I've set up a 
[portfolio](web/) for just that purpose!

### Teloga.com

The best learning experience I've had so far as a developer has been working
on [Teloga.com](http://www.teloga.com). Teloga Musician Networks is a 
website for music programs such as university bands to better connect with
their members, alumni, and recruits. We integrate a simple online registration
system for events into a sophisticated membership database so that programs
can have a definite source of information on their personnel.

The site is a product of Teloga, LLC, co-founded by my buddy
[James Dabbs](http://jdabbs.com) and myself. In addition to the software
engineering experience it's given me, I've also been in charge of Teloga's
sales and support. I talk a bit more about it in my 
[portfolio](web/).
