Thanks for checking out my site! My name is Steven Clontz, and I'm a

###Life

I grew up in the suburbs outside Huntsville, Alabama, and attended 
[Buckhorn High School](http://www.madison.k12.al.us/buckhorn/website/). 
I moved to Auburn, Alabama to attend [Auburn University](http://auburn.edu) 
and have stuck around ever since.

While she also grew up in Huntsville, I first met my wife Jessica 
in 2009 at Auburn. We married in June 2011, and look forward to many happy 
years together. Jessica is an elementary school teacher in the Auburn City 
school system.

###CV and Resume

I've serialized my education and work experience into a YAML file which is
a part of this site and generates [my CV/resume page](/resume/).
