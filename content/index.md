I'm a mathematician and educator who programs and develops for the web,
not to mention designing puzzles in-between.

Feel free to check out my
[blog](/blog/)
for a sampling of topics of interest to me. My
[resume/CV](http://resume.stevenclontz.com)
is available as well. I maintain several repositories on
[GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz)
which house many of my projects!
