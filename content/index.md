Welcome! If you want to learn more about me, this is the 
place. Some days I'm a mathematician. Other days I'm a software engineer. 
I've been known to design puzzles or games between teaching classes.

Feel free to check out my [blog](/blog/) for a sampling of topics of
interest to me. If you want the full biography, my 
[resume/CV](http://resume.stevenclontz.com) is online. I also maintain 
several repositories on [GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz) with 
examples of code and mathematical research between my other projects.
