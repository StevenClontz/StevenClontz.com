If you want to learn more about me, this is the 
place. The short version: I'm a mathematician and teacher who does web 
development, designing puzzles between writing code, teaching math, 
and doing research.

Feel free to check out my 
[blog](/blog/)
for a sampling of topics of interest to me. If you really want to
know everything I'm up to, my
[resume/CV](http://resume.stevenclontz.com)
is online. I also maintain several repositories on
[GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz)
which house many of my projects - not just code, but also some
puzzly/mathy stuff as well!
