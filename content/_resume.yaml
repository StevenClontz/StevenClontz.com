# sections describing experience
topics:
  - name: Research
    summary: >+
      Research interests include set theoretic topology and game theory, 
      particularly using the existence of perfect or limited-information strategies 
      in topological games to characterize topological properties of spaces. 
      
      Past research includes polyhedral unfoldings within solid geometry and the 
      structure of linearly ordered topological spaces.
