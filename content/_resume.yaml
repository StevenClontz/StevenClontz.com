  - title: Research
    summary:
      - >
        Current research involves the intersection of set-theoretic topology and
        infinite combinatorial games. In particular, this research includes
        results on characterizing covering properties using limited information
        strategies in topological games.
      - >
        Examples include Gruenhage's W-convergence game, Gruenhage's
        compact-point/compact game, Menger's covering game,
        Rothberger's covering game, and Bell's proximal game.
      - >
        Previous work involves stationary subsets of linearly ordered topological
        spaces and unfoldings of convex polyhedra into the plane.
