I have more to put here, but for now this page just showcases some examples of my work in web development and design. My full resume can be found at <http://resume.stevenclontz.com>. Check out my GitHub account at [@StevenClontz](http://github.com/StevenClontz).

## StevenClontz.com

My most obvious work is, of course, the website you are on! I have an older
version which ran using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) using a slight 
variation on its "Classic" theme. 

Since then, however, I've made the switch to [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws).

## Auburn University Bands

From 2007 until 2010 I served as the Webmaster and later Graduate Technology Assistant of the Auburn University Bands. The site was powered by [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/) with a custom theme I created to match the Auburn University web template at the time.

The Auburn Band has since changed their site design, but a copy of the site as of the end of 2010 is available at [Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20101231000533/http://band.auburn.edu/).

## AU Graduate Student Council

Before serving as the President of AU's graduate student government, I served 
in the Webmaster executive officer position from 2010-2011. The GSC lacked a 
website of any kind, so I adapted the [Wolf CMS](http://www.wolfcms.org/) 
framework and and the current 
[AU official web template](http://www.auburn.edu/template/) to create a 
powerful website which could be maintained completely through a web browser, 
and customized the official Auburn template to work with Wolf CMS.

The GSC still uses the the platform I created as of 2014-02-21, which is 
viewable at <http://auburn.edu/gsc>.

## Teloga Musician Networks

In 2012, [James Dabbs](http://www.jdabbs.com) and I cofounded **Teloga Musician Networks**, an online social network for helping music orgnaizations (such as high school or university band programs) manage their membership. The current incarnation of the site is based on the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and an adaptation of the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) theme.

We are currently refactoring the site from scratch, and will release a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) based redesign early in 2014.

## Puzzle Console

Part of my efforts in organizing the fifth [Auburn Puzzle Party puzzlehunt competition](http://auburnpuzzleparty.wikia.com/wiki/APP5) involved cocreating an online puzzle delivery and scoring platform based on the Django Framework along with James Dabbs.

The source to our [puzzle-console](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/puzzle-console) is freely available on GitHub. An archive of the site is available at <http://puzzle-console.herokuapp.com/>.

## GradeCalc

My most popular web application is probably my most simple - [GradeCalc](http://gradecalc.stevenclontz.com) is a [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws)-generated static site which answers one important quesiton for students: "What do I need to make on the final?" Source available on [Github](http://github.com/StevenClontz/GradeCalc).

## nanoc-au

CMS-powered sites are so 2000s. If you're serving static content, why use
a dynamic database? That's the beauty of [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws): you get
all the convenience of programmatically generating the pages of your site,
but you compile it all locally into static HTML.

I made a version stylized for [Auburn](http://stevenclontz.github.io/nanoc-au)
based on our [2013 Bootstrap Template](http://www.auburn.edu/template/2013/).
The code's on [GitHub](http://github.com/StevenClontz/nanoc-au), of course.
